# Development Workflow Standards

## Code Quality & Professionalism

### No Emojis in Code or PRs
- Never use emojis in code comments, commit messages, or PR descriptions
- Never use emojis in variable names, function names, or documentation
- Write professional, clear, and concise communication

### Professional PR Writing
- Write clear, descriptive PR titles that explain the "what" and "why"
- Include comprehensive descriptions with context, implementation details, and testing notes
- Use proper markdown formatting and structure
- Reference related issues or previous PRs when applicable
- Always fully implement all features, never take easier paths for a demo or hackathon
## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Never commit directly to main branch
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feat/add-user-auth, fix/payment-validation)
- Create PRs for all changes, even small fixes

## Quality Assurance Process

### Post-Code Quality Checks
After writing any code changes:

1. Lint: Run npm run lint to check code style and quality
2. Run eslint as well
3. Type Check: Run npm run type-check for TypeScript validation
4. Unit Tests: Run npm test to ensure unit tests pass
5. E2E Tests: Run npm run e2e:paid-tools for end-to-end validation (currently disabled in CI)
6. Build: Run npm run build to ensure clean compilation

### Testing Philosophy
- Never mock external dependencies or APIs
- Never use fallback implementations
- Test with real data and actual integrations
- Ensure all tests use production-like conditions

## Library Management

### Version Management
- Use recent, actively maintained libraries
- Pin all library versions in package.json to prevent unexpected updates
- Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Update libraries proactively but test thoroughly

### Library Selection
- Research and evaluate libraries before adding
- Prefer libraries with good TypeScript support
- Check maintenance status and community activity
- Always use the latest versions
- Consider bundle size and performance impact

## Documentation & Research

### MCP Tools Usage
- Use Context7 MCP for library and API documentation
- Use Tavily MCP for web search and finding documentation
- Consult official documentation before implementation
- Keep research notes for complex decisions

### Documentation Updates
- Update docs/ directory after any code changes
- Keep README.md current with setup and usage instructions
- Document breaking changes and migration guides
- Update API documentation for public interfaces

## Code Review Checklist

Before creating a PR, verify:

- [ ] All linting passes without errors or warnings
- [ ] All eslint warnings are fixed
- [ ] All unit tests pass locally
- [ ] All e2e tests pass locally (npm run e2e:paid-tools with sandbox)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation is clean
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate and tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly documented
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive and follow conventional commits
- [ ] CI pipeline passes (lint, test, e2e temporarily disabled)

## Examples

### Good PR Description
```
feat: implement user authentication with JWT tokens

## Context
Users need secure authentication for accessing protected resources.
This implements JWT-based auth following OAuth 2.0 standards.

## Implementation
- Added JWT token generation and validation
- Implemented password hashing with bcrypt
- Added middleware for route protection
- Created user registration and login endpoints

## Testing
- Unit tests for token validation logic
- E2E tests for complete auth flow
- Integration tests with real database

## Breaking Changes
- Authentication is now required for all API endpoints
- Migration guide: [link to migration docs]
```

### Good Commit Messages
```
feat: add user authentication middleware
fix: resolve payment validation race condition
docs: update API documentation for v2 endpoints
refactor: extract common database utilities
```

### Bad Examples
```
Added cool auth stuff
fix bug
updated docs
```
